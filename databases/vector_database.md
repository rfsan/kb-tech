# Databases - Vector Database

- Components of an application that uses vectors embeddings
    1. **Embedding Model** to create vector embeddings for the data we want to index
    2. **Vector Database** to save the vector embeddings
    3. **Content** to prepopulate the vector database.
- Vector database vs. vector index
    - A vector database has all the advantages of using a database
    - A vector database can store the vectors and the metadata associated with them. Then you can use the metadata to query the vector embeddings
